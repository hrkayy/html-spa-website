# HTML SPA Website

A simple Single Page-style website built with HTML, CSS, and media files. It uses multiple internal HTML sections linked together to create a smooth user experience without full page reloads — similar in feel to a SPA (Single Page Application). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📄 Pages & Files

This project includes:

- **home.html** – Main landing page  
- **prices.html** – Pricing or offerings page  
- **booking.html** – Booking page/form  
- **contact.html** – Contact page/form  
- **reels.html** – Media / reels section  
- **thankyou.html** – Confirmation/thank you page  
- **styles.css** – Main stylesheet  
- **facial1.mp4** & **facial3.mp4** – Embedded media assets

*(All content is static and served directly as HTML/CSS without backend.)*

## 🔎 What “SPA-style” Means

Although this site uses traditional HTML files, it’s structured to feel like a **Single Page Application (SPA)** — meaning navigation happens between sections without heavy reloads and delivers a smoother experience. SPAs typically load one main HTML page and update only parts of it dynamically. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🚀 Preview

You can open any of the `.html` files in a browser to preview the site — no server required!

Optionally, enable **GitHub Pages** in the repo settings to host it live. *(Settings → Pages → choose `main` branch)* :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
